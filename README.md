# deobfuscator-gui
An awesome GUI for an awesome deobfuscator

##What is Deobfuscator-GUI?
Deobfuscator-GUI is a GUI for the deobfuscator located at https://github.com/java-deobfuscator/deobfuscator.

It plans to make deobfuscating simple by having a UI, instead of having to deal with it from the command line.

I currently use WindowBuilder to create the GUI: https://eclipse.org/windowbuilder/

##How to Use 
1. Download the GUI from the releases page.
2. Download the deobfuscator.jar from https://github.com/java-deobfuscator/deobfuscator.

##TODO
-[x]Select deobfuscator.jar
-[]Input and output jar selection
-[]Load and select transformers from deobfuscator jar (double text panels to fix order)
-[]A list of libraries that can be loaded (manageable with add, remove) and adds rt.jar by default (probably going to use tabs to save space)
-[]Input and output command equivalent (that can be run with deobfuscator.jar)
-[]A console that can be used to check errors
