# deobfuscator-gui
An awesome GUI for an awesome deobfuscator

Select deobfuscator-gui.jar. The latest version works the best.

## What is Deobfuscator-GUI?
Deobfuscator-GUI is a GUI for the deobfuscator located at https://github.com/java-deobfuscator/deobfuscator.

It plans to make deobfuscating simple by having a UI, instead of having to deal with it from the command line.

I currently use WindowBuilder to create the GUI: https://eclipse.org/windowbuilder/

Any issues, suggestions, or pull requests are very welcome!

## How to Use 
1. Download the GUI from the releases page. (https://github.com/ThisTestUser/deobfuscator-gui/releases/latest)
2. Download the deobfuscator.jar from https://github.com/java-deobfuscator/deobfuscator.
3. Follow the program instructions.

## TODO
- [x] Select deobfuscator.jar
- [x] Input and output jar selection
- [x] Load and select transformers from deobfuscator jar (double text panels to fix order)
- [x] A list of libraries that can be loaded (manageable with add, remove)
- [x] Input and output command equivalent (that can be run via command prompt)
- [x] A console that can be used to check errors
